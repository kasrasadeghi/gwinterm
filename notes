I want to make a very very basic terminal emulator.

I want it to have a cursor and split windows.

The first release of the project requires a window with a cursor that shows the contents of a text file.
The cursor should go all of the way to the edge of the screen and then roll over with another right-arrow press.
Thus it should be controllable by keyboard arrows.

Components:
 - arrow key control
 - exit with C-d
 - cursor with rollover
 - show contents of text file

Next Steps: window splitting, IO
